  caption: "Structure of the stable manifold for a two-dimensional, chaotic map. Black\
    \ dots are points on the model attractor and red line is the local structure of\
    \ the stable manifold - all points on the stable manifold collapse to the same\
    \ point as they are integrated forward in time.\_The colors are a representation\
    \ of the distance between a point in the space and a specified model trajectory.\
    \ Note that the stable manifold lies in the minimum of this cost function space.\
